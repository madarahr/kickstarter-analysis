## An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
The Kickstarter project is an analysis of the data from fundraising campaigns between the year 2009 and 2017.  Various fundraising events have been analyzed to provide a deep insight to help future fundraising efforts.  The main categories are:
* Film & Video
* Food
* Games
* Journalism
* Music
* Photography
* Publishing
* Technology
* Theater

Out of the above categories, the most successful segment for fundraising has been within the category of Theater with its own successful subcategory of Plays.

It can clearly be seen that the most successful months for fundraising for the same category (Theater) are during May and June.  Additionally, the least successful month being December.

In the subcategory for Musicals in the U.K., it can be noticed that the historical mean campaign goal has been GBP 4,000 and half of the campaign goals are less than GBP 2,000.  25% of the Kickstarter campaigns for musicals in Great Britain received no funding at all indicating further analysis for future efforts.

Based on the analysis, it can hence be recommended that the most popular / successful category Theater would benefit by initiating fundraising during May & June and avoiding the month of December.

### Challenge

The fundraising outcome in terms of percentages of successful funding based on launch dates within the Theater category indicates that overall most months maintain a successful outcome over 60% except January, October and December.  December having the worst failure rate and the months of May and June having the most successful.

Further, within the Theater category, for the most successful fundraising subcategory of Plays, it is also evident that a goal amount of less than $5,000 was the most optimal to reach the goal.

The dataset lacks details on location of the subcategories within specific Cities / States within the U.S.A.  Having this information would help to surgically target certain categories or subcategories in the right location.

Additionally, the dataset could benefit if it captured details of the individual pledged names and amounts for each of the subcategories.  This would help perform descriptive analysis on each of the Plays as an example to in terms of setting goals for those specific Plays in the future.

Additional dissection of current dataset in the form of table and graphs to determine specifics on which particular Play failed to reach its goals against the launch date would help revisiting its goal and timing.  Performing deeper analysis in the second most popular subcategory similar to the Plays and identify the steps to improve their success.
