# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

The Kickstarter project is an analysis of the data from fundraising campaigns between the year 2009 and 2017.  Various fundraising events have been analyized to provide a deep insight to help future fundraising efforts.  The main categories are:
* Film & Video
* Food
* Games
* Journalism
* Music
* Photography
* Publishing
* Technology
* Theater

Out of the above categories, the most successful segment for fundraising has been within the category of Theater with its own successful subcategory of Plays.

Among the most successful fundraising subcategory of Plays, it is also evident that a goal amount of less than $5,000 was the most optimal to reach the goal.

In the subcategory for Muscicals in the U.K., it can be seen that the historical mean campaign goal has been GBP 4,000 and half of the campaign goals are less than GBP 2,000.  25% of the Kickstarter campaigns for musicals in Great Britain recieved no funding at all indicating further analysis for future efforts.

Based on the analysis, it can hence be recommended that the most popular category of Plays would benefit by initiating fundraising during May & June and avoiding the month of December.  Additionally, selecting a goal amount less than $5,000 would provide the most success in reaching the goals.
